# Turtle Race Game

## 🏁 About the Game
Turtle Race is a fun and interactive game built using Python's `turtle` module. Players can place bets on which turtle they think will win the race, and then watch as the turtles compete to reach the finish line first!

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the script `turtle_race.py`.
2. A prompt will appear asking you to bet on a turtle color (`red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, or `orange`).
3. The race begins! The turtles will move forward at random speeds.
4. Once a turtle crosses the finish line, the winner is announced.
5. If your chosen turtle wins, you win the bet; otherwise, the winning turtle's color is displayed.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Turtle Graphics (`turtle` module)
- Random module (`random` for random movement)

## 📌 Features
- User can input their bet before the race starts.
- Six different colored turtles compete in the race.
