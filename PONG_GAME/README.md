# Pong Game ðŸŽ®

A classic **Pong Game** built using Python's `turtle` module! This project is a part of my Python learning journey, where I implemented a two-player Pong game with smooth controls, ball physics, and a scoreboard.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… **Smooth Paddle Movements** - Controlled using `Up/Down` (Right Player) and `W/S` (Left Player)  
âœ… **Ball Movement & Collision Detection** - The ball bounces off walls and paddles dynamically  
âœ… **Scoreboard** - Keeps track of points for both players  
âœ… **Game Over Mechanism** - Resets when a player misses the ball  
âœ… **Speed Increase** - The ball speed increases after every successful paddle hit

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhinav23122021234/python-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the **PONG_GAME** folder:
   ```bash
   cd python-projects/PONG_GAME
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
