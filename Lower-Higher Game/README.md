# Lower Higher Game

A fun command-line game where you compare two random accounts and guess which one has more followers on social media. The game provides two accounts, and you must choose which one has more followers. If you guess correctly, you continue, and your score increases. If you're wrong, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

## Files
- **`art.py`**: Contains ASCII art for the game's logo and "vs" separator.
- **`game_data.py`**: A list of accounts with their details, including names, descriptions, countries, and follower counts.
- **`main.py`**: The main game logic, where the user interacts with the game, compares two accounts, and guesses which has more followers.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select two accounts from the list.
2. You will be asked to choose which account has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
3. If you guess correctly, your score increases, and the game continues with new random accounts.
4. If you guess wrong, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

## Game Flow

- **Step 1**: The game shows the logo and the names, descriptions, and countries of two accounts (A and B).
